# knuth-pdf – PDF library for C/WEB sources in TeX Live

Here you find a large collection of PDF documents for many C/WEB programs in
TeX\ Live, both in their original form as written by their respective authors,
and in the changed form as they are actually used in the TeX Live system.
Care has been taken to keep the section numbering intact, so that you can study
the sources and their changes in parallel.

Also included is the collection of ‘errata’ for Donald Knith's “Computers &
Typesetting series”.  Although not all the texts here are written or
maintained by Donald Knuth, it is more convenient for everything to be
collected in one place for reading and searching. And they all stem from the
system that Knuth created.  The central entry point is the ‘index’ file, with
links to the individual documents, either in HTML or in PDF format.

The `knuth-pdf` package is free software and may be used without constraints.
In part it is an update and replacement for the `latex-tds` package.

This is version “1.0” of the `knuth-pdf` package — 2021-03-09, AS.
