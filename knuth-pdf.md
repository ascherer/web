# knuth-pdf – PDF collection of typeset C/WEB sources in TeX Live

Here you find a large collection of PDF documents for many C/WEB programs in
TeX\ Live, both in their original form as written by their respective authors,
and in the changed form as they are actually used in the TeX Live system.  Care
has been taken to keep the section numbering intact, so that you can study the
sources and their changes in parallel.  Also included is the collection of
‘errata’ for Donald Knuth's “Computers & Typesetting” series.

Although not all the texts here are written or maintained by Donald Knuth, it
is more convenient for everything to be collected in one place for reading and
searching.  They all stem from the system that Knuth created.  The central
entry point is the ‘index’ file, with links to the individual documents, either
in HTML or in PDF format.

If you believe to have found anything that remains technically, historically,
typographically, or politically incorrect in any of these files, please feel
free to [report bugs in \TeX\ and friends](https://tug.org/texmfbug/).

The “License” of the `knuth-pdf` package is “Public Domain” and it covers only
the contents of this package, _not_ the various (and varying) “free software”
licenses of the presented software codes.

In part `knuth-pdf` is an update and replacement for the `latex-tds` package.

This is version “2.1” of the `knuth-pdf` package — 2023-06-11, Andreas Scherer.
